Philadelphia police tape off an area at Third and South Streets near the scene of a mass shooting late Saturday.

费城警方在周六晚间大规模枪击现场附近的第三街和南街的一个区域进行了录像。

My new life as a Philadelphian began, in essence, at the corner of Third and South Streets. It was a spring night in 1989 — I’d just turned 30 — and my future wife who’d just moved back to her Philly roots hustled this New York City chauvinist directly from 30th Street Station to the liveliest intersection she knew. Her idea was that a couple of margaritas from Copabanana and the blues coming from Bacchanal down the street would sell me on the notion that the City of Brotherly Love wasn’t the boring place of those W.C. Fields jokes I’d learned growing up.

我作为费城人的新生活实质上是在第三街和南街的拐角处开始的。那是 1989 年的一个春夜——我刚满 30 岁——我未来的妻子刚搬回费城，她把这位纽约市沙文主义者从第 30 街车站直接赶到了她所知道的最热闹的十字路口。她的想法是，一些来自 Copabanana 的玛格丽塔酒和来自街上 Bacchanal 的布鲁斯会让我相信兄弟之爱之城不是那些 W.C. 的无聊地方。我在成长过程中学到的菲尔兹笑话。

I guess her scheme worked, because not only am I still around, but we have a 29-year-old daughter who now lives about 1.5 miles from that corner. I can’t express my relief waking up this morning knowing she was out of town for the weekend — and thus 300 miles away from the carnage that cascaded across that very same stretch of South Street on a warm and crowded Saturday night in June, leaving dazed bystanders splattered in blood and three young dead bodies on the asphalt.

我猜她的计划奏效了，因为不仅我还在，而且我们还有一个 29 岁的女儿，她现在住在离那个拐角大约 1.5 英里的地方。今天早上醒来，我无法表达我的宽慰，因为她知道她周末不在城里——因此，在 6 月一个温暖而拥挤的周六晚上，距离南街同一段的大屠杀有 300 英里远，离开目瞪口呆的旁观者鲜血四溅，三具年轻的尸体倒在柏油路上。

Any personal relief was small consolation, though, amid the sickening feeling that gun violence is now tearing apart the very fabric of life here in the city where American democracy was founded — and that American democracy seems incapable of doing a damned thing to stop it. To a lot of folks around the country, waking up to the news that a Wild West-style scene of semiautomatic gunfire from multiple shooters not only killed those three people but wounded at least 11 others on South Street merely added Philadelphia to America’s fast-growing 2022 dishonor roll of mass-shooting locations, from Uvalde to Buffalo to Tulsa. The backstories vary, but the through line remains constant — too much firepower, in the world’s only nation with more guns than people.

然而，任何个人的解脱都是小小的安慰，在令人作呕的感觉中，枪支暴力现在正在撕裂美国民主建立的城市的生活结构——而美国民主似乎无法做一件该死的事情来阻止它。对于全国的很多人来说，一觉醒来，一个狂野西部风格的多枪手半自动枪击场景不仅杀死了这三个人，而且在南街还打伤了至少 11 人，这让费城加入了美国快速发展的城市。 2022 年大规模射击地点的耻辱卷，从乌瓦尔德到布法罗再到塔尔萨。背景故事各不相同，但主线始终如一——火力太大，在世界上唯一一个枪比人多的国家。

But people need to understand — it’s even worse than that. Just the Memorial Day weekend before, Philadelphia experienced — without much fanfare — a kind of a mini-Uvalde of a whopping 14 people killed by bullets, including a 37-year-old dad and his 9-year-old son sprayed by bullets in a car after coming home from a cookout, and a 1 a.m. shootout at an East Tioga Street party that left two women dead and wounded two others, including a 14-year-old girl. That the bloodshed wasn’t all in one place by one gunman apparently makes it less newsworthy, but arguably 16 shootings in one weekend in one city is more terrifying than one big one.

但人们需要理解——情况比这更糟。就在之前的阵亡将士纪念日周末，费城经历了一场——没有大张旗鼓——一种迷你乌瓦尔德，多达 14 人被子弹杀死，其中包括一名 37 岁的父亲和他 9 岁的儿子被子弹击中。野餐回家后的一辆汽车，以及凌晨 1 点在东 Tioga 街的一次派对上发生的枪战，造成两名妇女死亡，另外两人受伤，其中包括一名 14 岁的女孩。流血事件并非全部发生在一名枪手身上，这显然使其不那么具有新闻价值，但可以说，一个城市的一个周末发生 16 起枪击事件比一个大事件更可怕。

Because that’s what gun violence in America has become in 2022 — a vast, all-encompassing form of terrorism. Despite murder rates in Philadelphia and other locales rising to unacceptable levels, and despite the slew of mass shootings with AR-15-style killing machines, the odds that you personally will be shot remain small. But both the rising fear of violence — especially in cities that have spent decades climbing back from late-20th-century despair — and the demoralizing stories of helpless children cut down by bullets have created a wider sense of hopelessness about the American Experiment and whether it can be saved.

因为这就是 2022 年美国枪支暴力所变成的样子——一种规模庞大、包罗万象的恐怖主义。尽管费城和其他地区的谋杀率上升到令人无法接受的水平，并且尽管使用 AR-15 式杀戮机器发生了大量大规模枪击事件，但您个人被枪杀的可能性仍然很小。但是，对暴力的日益增长的恐惧——尤其是在从 20 世纪末期的绝望中恢复了几十年的城市——以及被子弹击倒的无助儿童的令人沮丧的故事，都让人们对美国实验以及它是否可以保存。

We know what the problems are. The violence occurs at the intersection of damaged people and their access to devices that allow them to kill people with such ease. I’ve written extensively about the people aspect — especially the crisis of our young men like the shooters in Buffalo and Uvalde and presumably on South Street, and I’ve also written a book that’s in part about how our broken education system makes this worse.

我们知道问题是什么。暴力发生在受伤害的人的交汇处，他们可以使用使他们如此轻松地杀人的设备。我写了大量关于人的方面的文章——尤其是我们年轻人的危机，比如布法罗和乌瓦尔德以及大概在南街的枪手，我还写了一本书，部分内容是关于我们破碎的教育系统如何使情况变得更糟.

But what’s really unique about America is the guns. That’s partly a factor of the staggering number of firearms — more than 400 million, in a nation of 331 million, double the rate of the next-closest nation, which is war-ravaged Yemen. But what’s also unique is the warped American mindset — that when 19 fourth graders and their two teachers are slaughtered in a Texas classroom, our neighbors in Canada enact gun control laws while here in the United States sales of the AR-15 used by the murderer have reportedly skyrocketed.

但美国真正独特的是枪支。这在一定程度上是枪支数量惊人的一个因素——在一个拥有 3.31 亿人口的国家中，枪支数量超过 4 亿支，是紧随其后的国家——饱受战争蹂躏的也门——的两倍。但同样独特的是美国扭曲的心态——当 19 名四年级学生和他们的两名老师在德克萨斯州的教室里被屠杀时，我们在加拿大的邻居制定了枪支管制法，而在美国销售凶手使用的 AR-15据说暴涨。

The shootings on South Street, and in Uvalde and Buffalo are a summons to our fundamental humanity. What’s frustrating is that we can think back to other times and other issues when America — despite its poisoned roots in white supremacy and patriarchy — could summon its better angels. In my lifetime, the images of police siccing dogs and spraying water cannons at Black people marching for their civil rights caused the majority to successfully end legal segregation, for example. Today, millions of Americans want both empathy and real action toward ending gun violence, yet we can name the irresistible object that stands in the way.

南街、乌瓦尔德和布法罗的枪击事件是对我们基本人性的召唤。令人沮丧的是，我们可以回想其他时代和其他问题，当时美国——尽管其根深蒂固的白人至上主义和父权制——可以召唤它的更好的天使。例如，在我的有生之年，警察在为争取公民权利而游行的黑人身上刺狗和喷水枪的画面使大多数人成功地结束了合法的种族隔离。今天，数以百万计的美国人希望在结束枪支暴力方面表现出同理心和真正的行动，但我们可以说出挡在路上的不可抗拒的物体。

It is the Republican Party, and those who enable its sick culture.

是共和党，以及那些促成其病态文化的人。

The column that I went to bed Saturday night thinking I was going to write today was actually about gun violence — but with a focus on the story of a Republican congressman from the Buffalo area, Rep. Chris Jacobs. Last month, Jacobs witnessed the nightmare in his own backyard — an 18-year-old addled by white supremacist propaganda, scoping out a predominantly Black supermarket on Buffalo’s East Side and killing 10 people there — and reacted not as a politician but as a human being. He said it was time to ban the sale of AR-15s and raise the age for gun ownership from 18 to 21. “I can’t in good conscience sit back and say I didn’t try to do something,” Jacobs said initially.

我周六晚上睡觉时以为我今天要写的专栏实际上是关于枪支暴力的——但重点是布法罗地区的共和党国会议员众议员克里斯·雅各布斯的故事。上个月，雅各布斯在他自己的后院目睹了这场噩梦——一个 18 岁的年轻人被白人至上主义的宣传所迷惑，在布法罗东区的一家以黑人为主的超市里搜寻并杀死了那里的 10 人——他的反应不是政治家而是人类存在。他说现在是禁止销售 AR-15 并将拥有枪支的年龄从 18 岁提高到 21 岁的时候了。“我不能凭良心坐下来说我没有尝试做某事，”雅各布斯最初说.

Having a conscience and trying to do something meant the end of Chris Jacobs’ career as a member of the Republican Party. Within hours of his statement, he was savaged by Donald Trump Jr., who wrote that Jacobs had “caved to the gun-grabbers,” and Jacobs suddenly saw 2022 GOP primary challengers crawling out of the woodwork. For supporting gun control, in one of the nation’s supposedly more liberal states, Jacobs was forced in little more than a week to end his reelection campaign and his short-lived career in Congress.

有良心并尝试做某事意味着克里斯·雅各布斯作为共和党成员的职业生涯的终结。在他发表声明的几个小时内，小唐纳德特朗普对他进行了猛烈抨击，他写道，雅各布斯已经“向抢枪者屈服”，而雅各布斯突然看到 2022 年共和党初选挑战者从木制品中爬出来。为了支持枪支管制，在该国一个据称更加自由的州，雅各布斯被迫在一周多一点的时间内结束他的连任竞选和他在国会短暂的职业生涯。

Apparently Jacobs hadn’t noticed that his own GOP no longer just supports expansive gun rights as a matter of differing policy, but now embraces heavy firepower as a lifestyle that’s wrapped in a cloth of Christian nationalism that barely hides its true nature as a beacon of white supremacy, in an ever-escalating culture war.

显然，雅各布斯并没有注意到他自己的共和党不再只是支持扩大枪支权利作为不同政策的问题，而是现在将强大的火力作为一种生活方式，这种生活方式被包裹在基督教民族主义的布上，几乎没有隐藏其作为灯塔的真实性质白人至上，在不断升级的文化战争中。

In the days between the shootings in Uvalde and on South Street, the Washington Post chronicled how firing an assault rifle has become a powerful and provocative image for Republican candidates in the 2022 midterms, including Pennsylvania GOP Senate nominee Mehmet Oz and the candidate he narrowly defeated, David McCormick, both of whom shot off weapons in their ads to prove their alleged manhood to base voters. Meanwhile, a new piece by Thomas Lecaque in the Bulwark outlines ties between Pennsylvania’s Republican gubernatorial nominee, Doug Mastriano, and a sect that literally worships guns, known as Rod of Iron Ministries.

在乌瓦尔德枪击案和南街枪击案之间的那几天，《华盛顿邮报》记录了在 2022 年中期选举中，对包括宾夕法尼亚州共和党参议员候选人穆罕默德·奥兹和他以微弱优势击败的候选人在内的共和党候选人来说，发射突击步枪如何成为一个强大而具有挑衅性的形象，大卫麦考密克，他们两人都在他们的广告中发射了武器，以向基础选民证明他们所谓的男子气概。与此同时，Thomas Lecaque 在 Bulwark 中的一篇新文章概述了宾夕法尼亚州共和党州长候选人 Doug Mastriano 与一个字面上崇拜枪支的教派（被称为铁杆教派）之间的联系。

This results in uncompromising policy. Here in Pennsylvania, conservatives are quick to blame any violence in Philadelphia on the city’s liberal Democratic leaders, including reform-minded DA Larry Krasner. They don’t want to talk about the guns, they don’t really want to talk about the cops (who were out in full force on South Street Saturday night, yet powerless to stop the carnage). And they definitely don’t want people to ponder how the NRA-funded, GOP-led legislature has thwarted the city’s efforts to enact local gun control.

这导致了不妥协的政策。在宾夕法尼亚州，保守派很快将费城的任何暴力事件归咎于该市的自由民主党领导人，包括具有改革思想的 DA Larry Krasner。他们不想谈论枪支，他们真的不想谈论警察（他们周六晚上在南街全力以赴，但无力阻止大屠杀）。他们绝对不希望人们思考 NRA 资助、共和党领导的立法机构如何阻挠该市制定地方枪支管制的努力。

That is tragic, because gun laws work. The neighboring states of New York and New Jersey, where progressive lawmakers and governors have enacted some gun control measures, have notably lower murder rates than Pennsylvania. An eye-opening report this weekend in the New York Times found that common-sense gun laws — such as uniformly raising the purchase age for assault rifles to 21 — could have saved 446 lives by stopping 35 separate incidents that had occurred since 1999′s Columbine school massacre.

这是可悲的，因为枪支法有效。进步的立法者和州长已经制定了一些枪支管制措施，邻近的纽约州和新泽西州的谋杀率明显低于宾夕法尼亚州。本周末《纽约时报》的一篇令人大开眼界的报道发现，常识性枪支法律——例如将突击步枪的购买年龄统一提高到 21 岁——可以通过阻止自 1999 年以来发生的 35 起独立事件来挽救 446 人的生命哥伦拜恩学校大屠杀。

But that’s not going to happen. Mitch McConnell and other Senate Republicans — desperately seeking to change the subject beyond “thoughts and prayers” — simply pay lip service to some incremental reforms after the worst mass shootings, hoping to run out the clock. Even the fiercest advocate for gun control on Capitol Hill, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, admitted Sunday that any post-Uvalde legislation will be small bore, that “[w]e’re not going to put a piece of legislation on the table that will ban assault weapons or pass comprehensive background checks.”

但这不会发生。米奇·麦康奈尔（Mitch McConnell）和其他参议院共和党人——拼命寻求改变话题，超越“思想和祈祷”——只是在最严重的大规模枪击事件后口头上进行一些渐进式改革，希望能用完时间。即使是国会山最激烈的枪支管制倡导者，康涅狄格州参议员克里斯墨菲周日也承认，任何后乌瓦尔德法案都将是小事，“[我们]不会将一项立法放在桌面上将禁止攻击性武器或通过全面的背景调查。”

So the best-case scenario is a two-America strategy — a union of blue states with some common-sense gun laws that won’t be free from the contagion, or the steady stream of heartbreaking news, from a confederacy of red states with unlimited gun rights ... and unlimited guns. I’m using Civil War nomenclature on purpose, because the last time that an immovable, large minority embraced a culture so fundamentally immoral was when the Southern states fashioned their identity around clinging to the power to enslave others.

所以最好的情况是两个美国的战略——一个蓝州联盟，有一些常识性的枪支法律，不会免于传染，或者来自红州联盟的源源不断的令人心碎的消息 无限的枪支权利......和无限的枪支。 我故意使用内战命名法，因为上一次一个不可动摇的、绝大多数人接受一种从根本上不道德的文化是当南方各州围绕着奴役他人的权力塑造他们的身份时。

America reached a point in 1861 where compromise was impossible, and amazingly we are again reaching that point today. The true moral majority of Americans must, with nonviolence, do whatever they can — at the ballot box in November, in our communities and in the streets, if necessary — to marginalize the indefensible, as happened in the 1960s with segregation. The alternatives are increasingly unthinkable.

美国在 1861 年达到了不可能妥协的地步，令人惊讶的是，我们今天再次达到了那个地步。 真正道德上的大多数美国人必须在非暴力的情况下，尽其所能——在 11 月的投票箱中，在我们的社区和街头，如有必要——将不可辩护的人边缘化，正如 1960 年代种族隔离所发生的那样。 替代方案越来越难以想象。
